stableNeighbors.py: initailly I thought it was max flow, but turned out to be a construction problem which requires key observations.

ponyExpress.cpp: For an optimal path from city C0 to city Ck+1, suppose we switched horse and used other horse at city C1,C2,C3,....CK. Now, for each path between Cm and Cm+1, (for instance, the path between C1 and C2), we did not switch horse and must have traveled along the minimum path from Cm to Cm+1, with the speed of horse from city Cm. Thus for each segment between city Cm and Cm+1, we could precalculate the minimum distance between them (through floyd-warshall algorithm, note that this value is fixed and will not change), and divide the distance by the speed of horse from Cm, to get the minimum time we would have spent on that segment (if we choose this segment in our optimal paths). Now, to find our optimal paths, we can find the minimum sum of time on each segment (through floyd-warshall).
