roundingError.py: firstly, do not use the python round function, because round(2.675,2) evaluates to 2.67 due to precision of floating numbers. Instead, we evaluate our fraction by modulo the numerator and the denominator. Let the modolo be M. Let the increment in fraction caused by adding one unit be C. We want to add multiple number of C to M so that the result is greater or equal to half of N+1. If M+C do not overflow N, we would always choose the largest M to add. Otherwise it is a bad idea to add C to M because the result wraps around and we are further aways from (N+1)/2. Thus I set a variable called sentinel, which equals to N-C. If M is smaller than sentinel, we are good. Otherwise, it is equivalent to have a staring offset at -(N-M) because we will wrap around when we add C.
