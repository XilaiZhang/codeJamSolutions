oversizedPancake.cpp: We first notice that the optimal result has the maximum number of pancakes that are used without leftovers. If we divide each original pancake size by 1 to D, we get N*\D candidates. If we binary search on the size of the pancake, the precision is good enough to pass the test cases. Instead, we record the fraction of each candidate pancake size, and binary search on the fractions to find the largest slice size possible (let us call it P). After that, we iterate over all candidate pancake size that is smaller than P and find the largest number of fully usable pancakes M (pancakes that are used without leftovers). From there our final answer is D-M.
