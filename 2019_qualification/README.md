cryptopangram.py: Initially I thought it was a simple gcd between neighboring pairs, but then realized that neighboring values could be the same. Let us call these value pairs with same values S pairs. To determine values in S, we can find the closest neighboring pair with different values, and propagate towards S. There are two scenarios when we encouter an S pair: 1. If we have already solved a previous gcd, we can simply remember the previous gcd and propagating from front to end. 2. If the beginning values are all same, we put them in an array and store them. Once we encounter a neighboring pair with different values, we can work backwards and determine values for all the S pairs stored in the array. Note that the second scenario can only happen once.
