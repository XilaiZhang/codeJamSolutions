pascalWalk.py: the sum of all numbers in line i of the pascal triangle is 2**(i-1). We express our target in binary form, if there is a 1 in the i th bit from right, we take all numbers on the i th line, otherwise we take a 1 on the sides. We prevent overshoot by subtracting 30 from our target, and compensate later by taking the 1s on the sides.
